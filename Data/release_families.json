FSD Beta's multi-camera video networks and next-gen planner, that allows for more complex agent interactions with less reliance on lanes, make way for adding more intelligent behaviors, smoother control and better decision making.- Improved recall for close-by cut-in cases by 15%, particularly for large trucks and high-yaw rate scenarios, through an additional 30k auto-labeled clips mined from the fleet. Additionally, expanded and tuned dedicated speed control for cut-in objects.- Improved the position of ego in wide lanes, by biasing in the direction of the upcoming turn to allow other cars to maneuver around ego.- Improved handling during scenarios with high curvature or large trucks by offsetting in lane to maintain safe distances to other vehicles on the road and increase comfort.- Improved behavior for path blockage lane changes in dense traffic. Ego will now maintain more headway in blocked lanes to hedge for possible gaps in dense traffic.- Improved lane changes in dense traffic scenarios by allowing higher acceleration during the alignment phase. This results in more natural gap selection to overtake adjacent lane vehicles very close to ego.- Made turns smoother by improving the detection consistency between lanes, lines and road edge predictions. This was accomplished by integrating the latest version of the lane-guidance module into the road edge and lines network.- Improved accuracy for detecting other vehicles' moving semantics. Improved precision by 23% for cases where other vehicles transition to driving and reduced error by 12% for cases where Autopilot incorrectly detects its lead vehicle as parked. These were achieved by increasing video context in the network, adding more data of these scenarios, and increasing the loss penalty for control-relevant vehicles.- Extended maximum trajectory optimization horizon, resulting in smoother control for high curvature roads and far away vehicles when driving at highway speeds.- Improved driving behavior next to row of parked cars in narrow lanes, preferring to offset and staying within lane instead of unnecessarily lane changing away or slowing down.- Improved back-to-back lane change maneuvers through better fusion between vision-based localization and coarse map lane counts.- Added text blurbs in the user interface to communicate upcoming maneuvers that FSD Beta plans to make. Also improved the visualization of upcoming slowdowns along the vehicle\u2019s path. Chevrons render at varying opacity and speed to indicate the slowdown intensity, and a solid line appears at locations where the car will come to a stop.- Improved the recall and precision of object detection, notably reducing the position error of semi-trucks by 10%, increasing the recall and precision of crossing vehicles over 100m away by 3% and 7%, respectively, and increasing the recall of motorbikes by 5%. This was accomplished by implementing additional quality checks in our two million video clip autolabeled dataset.- Reduced false offsetting around objects in wide lanes and near intersections by improving object kinematics modeling in low speed scenarios.- Adjusted position of Automatic Blind Spot Camera when FSD Beta is active to prioritize the Autopilot visualization.

Examples of improved cases include: turning when the turn lane is blocked by parked cars and avoiding turning into bus lanes. \r\r- Improved lane guidance module to feed in long range routing \"hints\" to the network for which lanes ego needs to be in to reach its destination. Also significantly improved per-lane routing type autolabeler. These changes combined resolved 64% of all interventions caused by bad routing type. \r\r- Improved geometric consistency between lane, line, road edge and restricted space detections by re-training our networks on the same dataset with the latest version of our \"lane guidance\" module, and by using a common features space to predict line, road edge and restricted space. \r\r- Improved recall for partial cut-ins by 39% and precision for false positive cut-ins due to lane changes into adjacent lanes by 66%, resulting in a 33% reduction in overall lane-changing prediction error. This was accomplished by further increasing our auto-labeled fleet dataset by 80k clips, improving the accuracy of the auto-labeling algorithm, and tuning the distribution of training supervision. \r\r- Improved understanding for when to use bus lanes and when to avoid them, by updating the lane type detection network and improving map-vision fusion. \r\r- Improved speed control during lane changes through better consideration of upcoming navigation deadlines, required back-to-back lane changes and presence of a vehicle behind ego. \r\r- Added new Vision Speed network to infer the typical driving speed on a given road. This is used to limit the maximum allowed speed in environments such as parking lots and residential roads. \r\r- Mitigated hydroplaning risk by making maximum allowable speed in Autopilot proportional to the severity of the detected road conditions. In extreme cases, Autopilot may use the wetness of the road, tire spray from other vehicles, rain intensity, tire wear estimation or other risk factors that indicate the vehicle is near the handling limit of the surface to warn the driver and reduce speed. \r\r- Improved long-range path blockage detection and control on city streets. Ego will now be able to perform lane changes due to upcoming path blockages earlier. \r\r- Improved developer productivity with better code diagnostics and C++20 features by upgrading compiler to clang-16.

Replay of previous collisions of this type suggests that 49% of the events would be mitigated by the new behavior. This improvement is now active in both manual driving and autopilot operation.Improved autopilot reaction time to red light runners and stop sign runners by 500ms, by increased reliance on object's instantaneous kinematics along with trajectory estimates.Added a long-range highway lanes network to enable earlier response to blocked lanes and high curvature.Reduced goal pose prediction error for candidate trajectory neural network by 40% and reduced runtime by 3X. This was achieved by improving the dataset using heavier and more robust offline optimization, increasing the size of this improved dataset by 4X, and implementing a better architecture and feature space.Improved occupancy network detections by oversampling on 180K challenging videos including rain reflections, road debris, and high curvature.Improved recall for close-by cut-in cases by 20% by adding 40k autolabeled fleet clips of this scenario to the dataset. Also improved handling of cut-in cases by improved modeling of their motion into ego's lane, leveraging the same for smoother lateral and longitudinal control for cut-in objects.Added \"lane guidance module and perceptual loss to the Road Edges and Lines network, improving the absolute recall of lines by 6% and the absolute recall of road edges by 7%.Improved overall geometry and stability of lane predictions by updating the \"lane guidance\" module representation with information relevant to predicting crossing and oncoming lanes.Improved handling through high speed and high curvature scenarios by offsetting towards inner lane lines.Improved lane changes, including: earlier detection and handling for simultaneous lane changes, better gap selection when approaching deadlines, better integration between speed-based and nav-based lane change decisions and more differentiation between the FSD driving profiles with respect to speed lane changes.Improved longitudinal control response smoothness when following lead vehicles by better modeling the possible effect of lead vehicles\u2019 brake lights on their future speed profiles.Improved detection of rare objects by 18% and reduced the depth error to large trucks by 9%, primarily from migrating to more densely supervised autolabeled datasets.Improved semantic detections for school busses by 12% and vehicles transitioning from stationary-to-driving by 15%. This was achieved by improving dataset label accuracy and increasing dataset size by 5%.Improved decision making at crosswalks by leveraging neural network based ego trajectory estimation in place of approximated kinematic models.Improved reliability and smoothness of merge control, by deprecating legacy merge region tasks in favor of merge topologies derived from vector lanes.Unlocked longer fleet telemetry clips (by up to 26%) by balancing compressed IPC buffers and optimized write scheduling across twin SOCs."}, {"update_name": "FSD Beta v11.3.1", "update_desc": "FSD Beta v11.3.1Autopilot ImprovementsEnabled FSD Beta on highway.

This unifies the vision and planning stack on and off-highway and replaces the legacy highway stack, which is over four years old. The legacy highway stack still relies on several single-camera and single-frame networks, and was setup to handle simple lane-specific maneuvers. FSD Beta's multi-camera video networks and next-gen planner, that allows for more complex agent interactions with less reliance on lanes, make way for adding more intelligent behaviors, smoother control and better decision making.\r\r- Improved recall for close-by cut-in cases by 15%, particularly for large trucks and high-yaw rate scenarios, through an additional 30k auto-labeled clips mined from the fleet. Additionally, expanded and tuned dedicated speed control for cut-in objects.\r\r- Improved the position of ego in wide lanes, by biasing in the direction of the upcoming turn to allow other cars to maneuver around ego.\r\r- Improved handling during scenarios with high curvature or large trucks by offsetting in lane to maintain safe distances to other vehicles on the road and increase comfort.\r\r- Improved behavior for path blockage lane changes in dense traffic. Ego will now maintain more headway in blocked lanes to hedge for possible gaps in dense traffic.\r\r- Improved lane changes in dense traffic scenarios by allowing higher acceleration during the alignment phase. This results in more natural gap selection to overtake adjacent lane vehicles very close to ego.\r\r- Made turns smoother by improving the detection consistency between lanes, lines and road edge predictions. This was accomplished by integrating the latest version of the lane-guidance module into the road edge and lines network.\r\r- Improved accuracy for detecting other vehicles' moving semantics. Improved precision by 23% for cases where other vehicles transition to driving and reduced error by 12% for cases where Autopilot incorrectly detects its lead vehicle as parked. These were achieved by increasing video context in the network, adding more data of these scenarios, and increasing the loss penalty for control-relevant vehicles.\r\r- Extended maximum trajectory optimization horizon, resulting in smoother control for high curvature roads and far away vehicles when driving at highway speeds.\r\r- Improved driving behavior next to row of parked cars in narrow lanes, preferring to offset and staying within lane instead of unnecessarily lane changing away or slowing down.\r\r- Improved back-to-back lane change maneuvers through better fusion between vision-based localization and coarse map lane counts.\r\r- Added text blurbs in the user interface to communicate upcoming maneuvers that FSD Beta plans to make.

This should make yellow light handling more natural and human-like.Improved the longitudinal slowdown control profile when leading up to stop sign intersections to make the overall maneuver feel more perceptible and natural.Improved the Tesla\u2019s speed adjustment when entering certain speed zones by allowing for earlier control for detected speed limit signs. The assertiveness of the response when slowing down for detected speed limit signs is determined by the current speed and its difference to the speed indicated by the detected sign. Added a visual glow behind the speed limit icon on the user-interface to alert the driver when the vehicle\u2019s set speed exceeds the detected speed limit by more than 50%. Finally, the option for an absolute Speed Limit offset in FSD Beta was removed; only the percent-based offset will be available.Updated the behavior for certain scenarios where the Tesla may maneuver from a turn lane to continue traveling straight. These maneuvers will now be treated as a lane change, where the turn indicator is used to alert other drivers of the Tesla\u2019s intent.As a reminder, the driver is responsible for vehicle operation even when FSD Beta is engaged.

Improved the architecture for better accuracy and latency, higher recall of far away vehicles, lower velocity error of crossing vehicles by 20%, and improved VRU precision by 20%.\rConverted the VRU Velocity network to a two-stage network, which reduced latency and improved crossing pedestrian velocity error by 6%.\rConverted the NonVRU Attributes network to a two-stage network, which reduced latency, reduced incorrect lane assignment of crossing vehicles by 45%, and reduced incorrect parked predictions by 15%.\rReformulated the autoregressive Vector Lanes grammar to improve precision of lanes by 9.2%, recall of lanes by 18.7%, and recall of forks by 51.1%.

All progress is good, however these release notes look very familiar to what's been released before and this update is probably no more than a bug fix release. Hopefully FSB v11 will not take any longer to be publically released as a result, and Musk is still suggesting the V11 release will be around Thanksgiving.\rOne consequence of this release seems to be the removal of the ability to send a snapshot following an event which means reporting problems is not possible. With FSDb now widely available to everyone in the Americas, there would simply be too much reporting of minor issues.\r\rAdded a new \"deep lane guidance\" module to the Vector Lanes neural network which fuses features extracted from the video streams with coarse map data, i.e. lane counts and lane connectivities. This architecture achieves a 44% lower error rate on lane topology compared to the previous model, enabling smoother control before lanes and their connectivities becomes visually apparent. This provides a way to make every Autopilot drive as good as someone driving their own commute, yet in a sufficiently general way that adapts for road changes.\r\r\r\rImproved overall driving smoothness, without sacrificing latency, through better modeling of system and actuation latency in trajectory planning. Trajectory planner now independently accounts for latency from steering commands to actual steering actuation, as well as acceleration and brake commands to actuation. This results in a trajectory that is a more accurate model of how the vehicle would drive. This allows better downstream controller tracking and smoothness while also allowing a more accurate response during harsh maneuvers. Improved unprotected left turns with more appropriate speed profile when approaching and exiting median crossover regions, in the presence of high speed cross traffic (\"Chuck Cook style\" unprotected left turno). This was done by allowing optimizable initial jerk, to mimic the harsh pedal press by a human, when required to go in front of high speed objects. Also improved lateral profile approaching such safety regions to allow for better pose that aligns well for oxiting the region. Finally, improved interaction with objects that are entering or waiting inside the median crossover region with better modeling of their future intent. Added control for arbitrary low-speed moving volumes from Occupancy Network. This also enables finer control for more precise object shapes that cannot be easily represented by a cuboid primitive. This required predicting velocity at every 3D voxel. We may now control for slow-moving UFOs. Upgraded Occupancy Network to use video instead of images from single time step. This temporal context allows the network to be robust to temporary occlusions and enables prediction of occupancy flow. Also, improved ground truth with semantics-driven outlier rejection, hard example mining, and increasing the dataset size by 2.4x. Upgraded to a new two-stage architecture to produce object kinematics (e.g. velocity, acceleration, yaw rate) where network compute is allocated (objects) instead of O(space). This improved velocity estimates for far away crossing vehicles by 20%, while using one tenth of the compute. Increased smoothness for protected right turns by improving the association of traffic lights with slip lanes vs yield signs with slip lanes. This reduces false slowdowns when there are no relevant objects present and also improves yielding position when they are present. Reduced false slowdowns near crosswalks. This was done with Improved understanding of pedestrian and bicyclist intent based on their motion. Improved geometry error of ego-relovant lanes by 34% and crossing lanes by 21% with a full Vector Lanes neural network update. Information bottlenecks in the network architecture wore eliminated by increasing the size of the per-camera feature extractors, video modules, internals of the autorogressive decoder, and by adding a hard attention mechanism which greatly improved the fine position of lanes. Made speed profile more comfortable when creeping for visibility, to allow for smoother stops when protecting for potentially occluded objects. Improved recall of animals by 34% by doubling the size of the auto-labeled training set, Enabled creeping for visibility at any intersection where objects might cross egos path, regardless of presence of traffic controls. Improved accuracy of stopping position in critical scenarios with crossing objects, by allowing dynamic resolution in trajectory optimization to focus more on areas where finer control is essential. Increased recall of forking lanes by 36% by having topological tokons participate in the attention operations of the autoregressivo decoder and by increasing the loss applied to fork tokens during training. Improved velocity error for pedestrians and bicyclists by 17%, espocially when ego is making a turn, by improving the onboard trajectory estimation used as input to the neural network. Improved recall of object detection, eliminating 26% of missing detections for far away crossing vehicles by tuning the loss function used during training and improving label quality.Improved object future path prediction in scenarios with high yaw rate by incorporating yaw rate and lateral motion into the likelihood estimation. This helps with objects turning into or away from ego's lane, especially in intersections or cut-in scenarios.Improved speed when entering highway by better handling of upcoming map speed changes, which increases the confidence of merging onto the highway.Reduced latency when starting from a stop by accounting for lead vehicle jerk.Enabled faster identification of red light runners by evaluating their current kinematic state against their expected braking profile.\r\rSee all the 2022.36 release notes"}, {"update_name": "In App Mail", "update_desc": "In App MailNot directly related to the car release, but coming out at the same time is a new in app email Inbox.\r\rThis is one part of the app that has been consistently under used by Tesla, we can recall only a small handful of messages over the 7 years we've owned Teslas.

This architecture achieves a 44% lower error rate on lane topology compared to the previous model, enabling smoother control before lanes and their connectivities becomes visually apparent. This provides a way to make every Autopilot drive as good as someone driving their own commute, yet in a sufficiently general way that adapts for road changes.\r\rImproved overall driving smoothness, without sacrificing latency, through better modeling of system and actuation latency in trajectory planning. Trajectory planner now independently accounts for latency from steering commands to actual steering actuation, as well as acceleration and brake commands to actuation. This results in a trajectory that is a more accurate model of how the vehicle would drive. This allows better downstream controller tracking and smoothness while also allowing a more accurate response during harsh maneuvers.\r\rImproved unprotected left turns with more appropriate speed profile when approaching and exiting median crossover regions, in the presence of high speed cross traffic (\"Chuck Cook style\" unprotected left turns). This was done by allowing optimisable initial jerk, to mimic the harsh pedal press by a human, when required to go in front of high speed objects. Also improved lateral profile approaching such safety regions to allow for better pose that aligns well for exiting the region. Finally, improved interaction with objects that are entering or waiting inside the median crossover region with better modeling of their future intent.\r\rAdded control for arbitrary low-speed moving volumes from Occupancy Network. This also enables finer control for more precise object shapes that cannot be easily represented by a cuboid primitive. This required predicting velocity at every 3D voxel. We may now control for slow-moving UFOs.\r\rUpgraded Occupancy Network to use video instead of images from single time step. This temporal context allows the network to be robust to temporary occlusions and enables prediction of occupancy flow. Also, improved ground truth with semantics-driven outlier rejection, hard example mining, and increasing the dataset size by 2.4x.\r\rUpgraded to a new two-stage architecture to produce object kinematics (e.g. velocity, acceleration, yaw rate) where network compute is allocated O(objects) instead of O(space). This improved velocity estimates for far away crossing vehicles by 20%, while using one tenth of the compute.\r\rIncreased smoothness for protected right turns by improving the association of traffic lights with slip lanes vs yield signs with slip lanes. This reduces false slowdowns when there are no relevant objects present and also improves yielding position when they are present.\r\rReduced false slowdowns near crosswalks. This was done with improved understanding of pedestrian and bicyclist intent based on their motion.\r\rImproved geometry error of ego-relevant lanes by 34% and crossing lanes by 21% with a full Vector Lanes neural network update. Information bottlenecks in the network architecture were eliminated by increasing the size of the per-camera feature extractors, video modules, internals of the autoregressive decoder, and by adding a hard attention mechanism which greatly improved the fine position of lanes.\r\rMade speed profile more comfortable when creeping for visibility, to allow for smoother stops when protecting for potentially occluded objects.\r\rImproved recall of animals by 34% by doubling the size of the auto-labeled training set.\rEnabled creeping for visibility at any intersection where objects might cross ego's path, regardless of presence of traffic controls.\r\rImproved accuracy of stopping position in critical scenarios with crossing objects, by allowing dynamic resolution in trajectory optimization to focus more on areas where finer control is essential.\rIncreased recall of forking lanes by 36% by having topological tokens participate in the attention operations of the autoregressive decoder and by increasing the loss applied to fork tokens during training.\rImproved velocity error for pedestrians and bicyclists by 17%, especially when ego is making a turn, by improving the onboard trajectory estimation used as input to the neural network.\rImproved recall of object detection, eliminating 26% of missing detections for far away crossing vehicles by tuning the loss function used during training and improving label quality.\rImproved object future path prediction in scenarios with high yaw rate by incorporating yaw rate and lateral motion into the likelihood estimation. This helps with objects turning into or away from ego's lane, especially in intersections or cut-in scenarios.\rImproved speed when entering highway by better handling of upcoming map speed changes, which increases the confidence of merging onto the highway.\rReduced latency when starting from a stop by accounting for lead vehicle jerk.\rEnabled faster identification of red light runners by evaluating their current kinematic state against their expected braking profile.\r\rPress the \"Video Record\" button on the top bar UI to share your feedback.

This enables us to predict crossing lanes, allows computationally cheaper and less error prone post-processing, and paves the way for predicting many other signals and their relationships jointly and end-to-end. - Use more accurate predictions of where vehicles are turning or merging to reduce unnecessary slowdowns for vehicles that will not cross our path. - Improved right-of-way understanding if the map is inaccurate or the car cannot follow the navigation. In particular, modeling intersection extents is now entirely based on network predictions and no longer uses map-based heuristics. - Improved the precision of VRU detections by 44.9%, dramatically reducing spurious false positive pedestrians and bicycles (especially around tar seams, skid marks, and rain drops). This was accomplished by increasing the data size of the next-gen autolabeler, training network parameters that were previously frozen, and modifying the network loss functions. We find that this decreases the incidence of VRU-related false slowdowns. - Reduced the predicted velocity error of very close-by motorcycles, scooters, wheelchairs, and pedestrians by 63.6%. To do this, we introduced a new dataset of simulated adversarial high speed VRU interactions. This update improves autopilot control around fast-moving and cutting-in VRUs. - Improved creeping profile with higher jerk when creeping starts and ends. - Improved control for nearby obstacles by predicting continuous distance to static geometry with the general static obstacle network. - Reduced vehicle \"parked\" attribute error rate by 17%, achieved by increasing the dataset size by 14%. Also improved brake light accuracy. - Improved clear-to-go scenario velocity error by 5% and highway scenario velocity error by 10%, achieved by tuning loss function targeted at improving performance in difficult scenarios. - Improved detection and control for open car doors. - Improved smoothness through turns by using an optimization-based approach to decide which road lines are irrelevant for control given lateral and longitudinal acceleration and jerk limits as well as vehicle kinematics. - Improved stability of the FSD Ul visualizations by optimizing ethernet data transfer pipeline by 15%. - Improved recall for vehicles directly behind ego, and improved precision for vehicle detection network."}, {"update_name": "Full Self-Driving (Beta)", "update_desc": "Full Self-Driving (Beta)Full Self-Driving is in early limited access Beta and must be used with additional caution.
